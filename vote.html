			<h1>VOTE: US Citizens Abroad</h1>
		</article>

		<!-- Why -->
		<article>
			<h2>Your Vote from Abroad Matters</h2>
			<p><span class="large-text">So.</span> You left the United States. Maybe for good. Maybe temporarily. Maybe you're traveling for a while.</p>
			<p>From a distance, you see that US politics seem to be a mess. But, you think, <i>“What can I do? I'm just one person hundreds or thousands of miles away from the United States.”</i></p>
			<p>You can register and vote as an American abroad. It's super simple, and in many states you can do it all via email. Make your voice heard. Get registered and vote!</p>

			<h2>Steps to register & vote from abroad</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="steps">1. </span>Determine your <em>voting residence state or territory</em> <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter" target="_blank">here</a> and confirm you are eligible to be an overseas voter.</li>
				<li><span class="steps">2. </span>Register to vote and request a special overseas absentee ballot by filling out the <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/fpca-privacy-notice" target="_blank"><em>Federal Post Card Application</em></a> (FPCA). When you visit this website, your will click to accept the privacy statement, select your voting residence state, and then click through following the directions on the website.</li>
				<li><span class="steps">3. </span>Send in your FPCA to the election office in your state. Bonus! Many states don't require that you mail the application in, and instead you can email or fax it in. So much easier for people living abroad.</li>
				<li><span class="steps">4. </span>Once your state's election office has received your application, they will approve your FPCA, disapprove it, or request additional information.</li>
				<li><span class="steps">5. </span>After your FPCA is approved, your election office will send you an absentee ballot. They send this to you using the method you requested on your application(i.e.: via email!).</li>
				<li><span class="steps">6. </span>Complete and return your absentee ballot to your election office by your state's deadline. Again, you might not have to mail your ballot. Your state will let you know which alternative methods you can use – like, email or fax!</li>
				<li><span class="steps">7. </span>7. Your FPCA is only valid for one calendar year, so be sure to renew your paperwork at the beginning of each new year!</li>

			<h2>FAQs</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>How do I determine my voting residence?
					<p>Your voting residence is the last address you had in the state in which you were last domiciled, immediately prior to leaving the United States.</p>
				</li>

				<li>Can I still have voting residence in my former state even though I know longer own property there, rent there, or have any other ties to the state?
					<p>Yes!</p>
				</li>

				<li>Can I still have voting residence in my former state even though I no intention of returning to that state or my return date is uncertain?
					<p>Yes!</p>
				</li>
				<li>Are my votes secret?
					<p>Not always. Some states are unable to provide secret ballot and you will need to consent to a waiver of secret ballot to register in these states.</p>
				</li>
				<li>I don't have a scanner, how am I supposed to return my completed FPCA?
					<p>If you have a cellphone with a camera, take a photo of your completed application and attach that photo to the email you return to your state election office. Or, for even better quality, download a free scanner app (i.e.: CamScanner) to your phone and scan your application as a pdf using your cellphone. Then, attach the pdf to the email you send to your state's election office.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Will voting from overseas impact how I do/don't pay state taxes?
					<p>Per the Federal Voting Assistance Program, “Voting in an election for federal offices often may not be used as the sole basis of determining residency for the purpose of imposing State and local taxes.“ What this means for most people is that if you only vote for Federal office candidates, your state and local tax liability will not be affected. But! Each state handles this differently, and voting for state or local offices may affect your tax liability. If you have specific concerns, read <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter" target="_blank">your state's absentee voting guidelines</a> and/or talk to a tax professional that specializes in ex-pat taxes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>I am a US citizen that was born outside of the US and I have never lived in the United States, can I still vote?
					<p>Maybe. There are 37 states plus the District of Columbia that allow US citizens who have never lived in the US to still vote absentee. Qualifying for this depends on what state(s) your US-citizen parent(s) most recently resided or resides in. See <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/reside" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.</p>
				</li>
				<li>I'm a student studying abroad, Can I still vote?
					<p>Yes, you qualify! <a href="#steps">Register</a> to vote absentee and then vote! Then, be a hero and get your American classmates signed up too – this is <em>your future</em>!</p>
				</li>
				<li>Can I vote in the primary?
					<p>Yes! The process is the same. Check your state for their deadlines.</p>
				</li>
				<li>What are the deadlines to to register to vote from abroad?

				</li>
				<li>What is the deadline to request a ballot?

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hi. My name is Stacy Montemayor and I made this website. I am a US citizen living in Mexico, and I vote. I believe in voting rights for all Americans, including those not located in the United States. I also believe that voter restrictions – which make it harder for people to vote – are bullshit.
